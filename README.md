## A random clone of Tempest in pygame ##


This is a proof of concept game made for an assignment for the graphics cource in our university (University of Thessaly). The player has the base mechanics of the original game but everything else is different. The enemies can shoot instead of climbing up. There are no spikes, the levels are defined by svg shapes. There is no scoring system. Feel free to contribute if you want to make the game much closer to original. We would like if we could approach a close successor to Tempest 3000.
